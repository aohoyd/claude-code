You are tasked with helping the user create a new Claude Agent SDK application. Follow these steps carefully:

## Reference Documentation

Before starting, review the official documentation to ensure you provide accurate and up-to-date guidance. Use WebFetch to read these pages:

1. **Start with the overview**: https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/overview
2. **Based on the user's language choice, read the appropriate SDK reference**:
   - TypeScript: https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/typescript
   - Python: https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/python
3. **Read relevant guides mentioned in the overview** such as:
   - Streaming vs Single Mode
   - Permissions
   - Custom Tools
   - MCP integration
   - Subagents
   - Sessions
   - Any other relevant guides based on the user's needs

**IMPORTANT**: Always check for and use the latest versions of packages. Use WebSearch or WebFetch to verify current versions before installation.

## Gather Requirements

Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to gather requirements. Skip any questions the user has already answered via arguments.

**Question 1 - Language choice:**
```
Question: "Which programming language would you like to use?"
Header: "Language"
Options:
  - TypeScript (Modern JavaScript with types, great tooling)
  - Python (Simple syntax, extensive ecosystem)
```

**Question 2 - Project name** (skip if $ARGUMENTS provided):
```
Question: "What would you like to name your project?"
Header: "Name"
Options:
  - my-agent (Simple default name)
  - claude-assistant (Assistant-style agent)
  - [User provides custom name via "Other"]
```

**Question 3 - Agent type:**
```
Question: "What kind of agent are you building?"
Header: "Agent type"
Options:
  - Coding agent (SRE, security review, code review)
  - Business agent (Customer support, content creation)
  - Data agent (Analysis, processing, reporting)
  - Custom agent (I'll describe my use case)
```

**Question 4 - Starting point:**
```
Question: "What starting point would you like?"
Header: "Template"
Options:
  - Minimal (Hello World example to start from scratch)
  - Basic (Agent with common features pre-configured)
  - Full-featured (Complete example with tools, MCP, subagents)
```

**Question 5 - Tooling choice:**
```
Question: "Which package manager do you prefer?"
Header: "Package mgr"
Options:
  - npm (Recommended) (Default Node.js package manager)
  - pnpm (Fast, disk-efficient)
  - yarn (Alternative with workspaces support)
  - bun (Fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime)
```
(For Python, ask about pip vs poetry vs uv instead)

After all questions are answered, proceed to create the setup plan.

## Setup Plan

Based on the user's answers, create a plan that includes:

1. **Project initialization**:

   - Create project directory (if it doesn't exist)
   - Initialize package manager:
     - TypeScript: `npm init -y` and setup `package.json` with type: "module" and scripts (include a "typecheck" script)
     - Python: Create `requirements.txt` or use `poetry init`
   - Add necessary configuration files:
     - TypeScript: Create `tsconfig.json` with proper settings for the SDK
     - Python: Optionally create config files if needed

2. **Check for Latest Versions**:

   - BEFORE installing, use WebSearch or check npm/PyPI to find the latest version
   - For TypeScript: Check https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
   - For Python: Check https://pypi.org/project/claude-agent-sdk/
   - Inform the user which version you're installing

3. **SDK Installation**:

   - TypeScript: `npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk@latest` (or specify latest version)
   - Python: `pip install claude-agent-sdk` (pip installs latest by default)
   - After installation, verify the installed version:
     - TypeScript: Check package.json or run `npm list @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`
     - Python: Run `pip show claude-agent-sdk`

4. **Create starter files**:

   - TypeScript: Create an `index.ts` or `src/index.ts` with a basic query example
   - Python: Create a `main.py` with a basic query example
   - Include proper imports and basic error handling
   - Use modern, up-to-date syntax and patterns from the latest SDK version

5. **Environment setup**:

   - Create a `.env.example` file with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
   - Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
   - Explain how to get an API key from https://console.anthropic.com/

6. **Optional: Create .claude directory structure**:
   - Offer to create `.claude/` directory for agents, commands, and settings
   - Ask if they want any example subagents or slash commands

## Implementation

After gathering requirements and getting user confirmation on the plan:

1. Check for latest package versions using WebSearch or WebFetch
2. Execute the setup steps
3. Create all necessary files
4. Install dependencies (always use latest stable versions)
5. Verify installed versions and inform the user
6. Create a working example based on their agent type
7. Add helpful comments in the code explaining what each part does
8. **VERIFY THE CODE WORKS BEFORE FINISHING**:
   - For TypeScript:
     - Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check for type errors
     - Fix ALL type errors until types pass completely
     - Ensure imports and types are correct
     - Only proceed when type checking passes with no errors
   - For Python:
     - Verify imports are correct
     - Check for basic syntax errors
   - **DO NOT consider the setup complete until the code verifies successfully**

## Verification

After all files are created and dependencies are installed, use the appropriate verifier agent to validate that the Agent SDK application is properly configured and ready for use:

1. **For TypeScript projects**: Launch the **agent-sdk-verifier-ts** agent to validate the setup
2. **For Python projects**: Launch the **agent-sdk-verifier-py** agent to validate the setup
3. The agent will check SDK usage, configuration, functionality, and adherence to official documentation
4. Review the verification report and address any issues

## Getting Started Guide

Once setup is complete and verified, provide the user with:

1. **Next steps**:

   - How to set their API key
   - How to run their agent:
     - TypeScript: `npm start` or `node --loader ts-node/esm index.ts`
     - Python: `python main.py`

2. **Useful resources**:

   - Link to TypeScript SDK reference: https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/typescript
   - Link to Python SDK reference: https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/python
   - Explain key concepts: system prompts, permissions, tools, MCP servers

3. **Common next steps**:
   - How to customize the system prompt
   - How to add custom tools via MCP
   - How to configure permissions
   - How to create subagents

## Important Notes

- **ALWAYS USE LATEST VERSIONS**: Before installing any packages, check for the latest versions using WebSearch or by checking npm/PyPI directly
- **VERIFY CODE RUNS CORRECTLY**:
  - For TypeScript: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` and fix ALL type errors before finishing
  - For Python: Verify syntax and imports are correct
  - Do NOT consider the task complete until the code passes verification
- Verify the installed version after installation and inform the user
- Check the official documentation for any version-specific requirements (Node.js version, Python version, etc.)
- Always check if directories/files already exist before creating them
- Use the user's preferred package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm for TypeScript; pip, poetry for Python)
- Ensure all code examples are functional and include proper error handling
- Use modern syntax and patterns that are compatible with the latest SDK version
- Make the experience interactive and educational
- **USE AskUserQuestion TOOL** - Always use the AskUserQuestion tool for gathering user input, not plain text questions

Begin by using AskUserQuestion to ask the first requirement question. You can ask 1-4 related questions per AskUserQuestion call.
